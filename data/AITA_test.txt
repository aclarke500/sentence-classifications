My older sister constantly used the expensive colouring pencils I saved up for over a year to buy (and constantly anxiously checking this big box was still for sale whenever we were in the store).
My closest friends are twins, and they don't even mess with each other's makeup without asking.
I would also ask your wife if her supporting her brother and his daughters with them stealing and harming your daughters things is worth the strain on hers and your daughters relationship.
it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for  bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this "defect" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.
they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on.
Sammy is a shit brother, uncle, AND father.
Would that not also make the BILs child defective, by his standards?!
Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.
Yeah cuz that would make dealing and resolving the situation WAY easier huh?
OP you need to talk to your daughter and alsolet her know if her mother says anything that makes her upset she can come to you and trust you.
"She's much better at drawing than you are, so stop whining!" Can't reply anymore since the thread is locked, but thank you all for your kind words and understanding.
This is some relationship ruining shit because teenagers need privacy and want to know they are safe in their own home.
I guarantee she won't appreciate sharing anymore.
I love this idea.
After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior.
Last straw was when Zoey bought a $ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it.
My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this.
The divorce thing seems significantly less surprising now, knowing that this is how he actually behaves as a grown ass adult.
NTA OP - you have your daughters back and totally get her need for privacy and autonomy over her stuff.
It also bothers me that Sammy dared to call Zoey "defective" when his kids are taking and ruining other people's property.
Tell her that her not backing her up and making excuses for horrible behaviour will make her feel not safe in her own home and not cared for by her mother.
Quite frankly, as soon as that worthless BIL opened his mouth to insist his daughters "aren't thieves," I would have let him know that taking items from someone without their knowledge or consent constitutes theft, and those who engage in theft are, in fact, thieves.
He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane) with him a couple of months ago.

Plus if the colors were mixed she was definitely double dipping.
