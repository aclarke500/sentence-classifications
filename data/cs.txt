I'm pretty surprised to be honest and did not expect it, especially considering I joined as a junior several years ago completely self taught (then later went on to get my degree as the company paid for it).

We're a big tech company, fully remote, starting pay for juniors is around ~150k USD.

According to upper management, it's because the volume of self-taught applicants is too high (a few thousand per posting) and the quality of self-taught applicants is too low. Apparently a lot of teams have hired self taught developers and it's gone very bad.

So as a result, the company announced Friday that it would no longer be hiring self-taught applicants and instead will require candidates to have a degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or Software Engineering.

Anyone else experienced this?

t's a buyer's market. So they can be choosy.

If you are the engineer that does the first technical interview (the screen), you understand...

The variance of self-taught developers is just too high compared to the variance of CS/CE graduates. There are plenty of people with degrees looking for jobs right now, so it makes way more sense to hire the low-risk average-reward option.

We were given that directive well before the pandemic when bootcamps started popping off. It's not that self taught couldn't be good, it was that it was easier finding someone equally good and passionate with a CS degree if you were offering competitive compensation. There's just less roughs to sift through to find the diamond when you start with only degree holders.

I'm not a mathematician but am I wrong in thinking cryptographers and mathematicians in the number theory/cryptography area usually go for analyst and intelligence positions? Is that outside of what you want to do?

I think standards organizations like NIST or government agencies like the NSA do look for cryptographers or mathematicians who are specialized in that area even if it's not a developer job.

I kinda like to smoke weed occasionally and I didn't finish my PhD, so I'm not the most attractive candidate for a lot of the good cryptography positions. I wrote a lot of code in school and during my side jobs, so i don't find myself struggling as a developer. Everyone wants a job in big tech, but I guess I'll have to wait until I'm mid-level to apply.

Im a physics grad here as well. I wouldn't really think twice about this at the end of the day. Just apply and move on if they don't send back. The real issue here isn't about credentials, its the fact that companies are overwhelmed with applicants and most of them are shit (they lie, they scam, they get overwmployed, they don't care about the company just about collecting that paycheck). The key is to somehow bypass this lineup of trash. You need to get vetted somewhere.

You made me remember when I started my PhD and was forced to go from Python to Fortran. Back then I named variables as their physical counterpart. So lets say you have a light and a heavy particle, name their massss m and M, obviously. It took me a few days to realise that Fortran doesn't distinguish between lower and upper case!

Hah, I've worked with many mathematicians and physicists and this is what I never got. They go through those really difficult studies and then are not able to see the advantage of descriptive variable names. Or version control that's not Google drive. And generally don't have a huge mess in their code and everywhere. I am far from those OCD code polish devs but what I've seen from them is crazy. Some server with million scripts everywhere, random text files for notes everywhere.

I was one of the few CS background people at a telecommunications research center where I did my PhD... with lots of EEs, physicists, mathematicians and me and my other CS colleague often felt like janitors.

That's what interviews are for. I've met plenty of very mediocre software engineers with degrees. I would say its harder to find that in successful self taught people because they don't get hired for having the degree alone. Using the degree system in CS is actually bonkers to me because it's often way different than the work and taught by people who've never done the work.

The variance is pretty high regardless which is why your hiring process should use the interview to reduce that variance. Not something as arbitrary as a degree requirement.

That being said, for a field that has some of the smartest people creating clever solutions every day, it is also swamped by mediocrity.

The problem here is the distribution of skill and scalability. We can't interview everyone who lands a resume at our table, not even close. So the observation is made that self taught devs skew lower in comparison to college educated devs. A dev who's one standard deviation above the average college taught dev might be two standard deviations above the average self taught dev(obviously hypothetical numbers). So that observation is used to help the process scale by cutting down the already overwhelming amount of candidates into a still slightly overwhelming amount of candidates with college education.

Yes that's what interviews are for but companies dont want to interview that many people and will always take the path of least resistance, they need arbitrary restrictions of barrier to entry. Right now that is having a CS degree. I am willing to bet in 5-10 years it will be WHICH college you go to and it's ranking.

Already is where I work. Specifically universities we trust. Remember we have a pretty good amount of data on which schools have graduated people that worked out best for us. And we go further and have relationships with professors. We specifically have our best employees spend some time in outreach to their alma mater and the professors that teach the classes most closely related to our work.

Interviews take time.

It would be dope if companies could interview every single person who applies for a position, but that’s simply not possible. Resumes and degrees quite literally exist as filters to maximize candidate quality while minimizing time spent interviewing.

So maybe you’re right that a self-taught person who got into development is better than your median CS grad. But being the first company to hire that self-taught person is a massive risk.

I don’t really agree. For a Junior position you are hiring people with little to no experience. Having a degree shows you had the perseverance to complete the degree, and that you at least have some basic knowledge. This does decrease the variance.

Even where you got your degree can decrease the variance(some are more theoretical, some more focused on software development etc).

Easier for us to select specific universities we trust. We have a relationship with the professors from those and know they don’t inflate grades or give out recommendations like candy. That gives us a first order filter. The interview is then for finding the best within that group.

Counter intuitively, we've never seen so many unqualified applicants with our open positions. Our fail rate for interview loops is way up.

I don't know what to make of it. Maybe folks are less likely to job hop at this moment so we're only getting those who were let go or couldn't find a job? I know it wasn't only low performers who have been laid off, but not sure what to make of the situation otherwise.

Big tech continues to hire (although significantly less) and they can’t pay juniors less than what the established range for juniors is inside the company. The crazy stock sign on bonuses may be gone, but the standard base plus yearly bonus will still make it so compensation for new hires is around $150k+ for new grads in big N.

Even today many years later running my own business, my value in some peoples’ minds (many of my clients have advanced degrees) is diminished when they find I don’t have a degree. I wish I had just finished. If you’re under 25 and can afford to spend a couple years getting a degree, do it.

It’s a matter of priorities. I’m in my 40s and likely past the halfway point of my career. With the amount of time it would take to go back and finish (likely having to redo many classes at this point), I could instead complete dozens of projects for clients worth over $500k in aggregate (note that includes funds I pay to my employees). If my work dried up completely, I’d probably go back though.

I appreciate your anecdotal experience. It makes me feel better about myself! 20 years in, and I still am struggling with imposter syndrome.

If you take a broad view of "big tech" it's pretty believable. Airbnb, Dropbox, Pinterest, Instacart, Shopify, Square are fully remote and pay in that range for new grads. And a lot of tech companies historically have been willing to interview self-taught people, if their resumes stick out in some other way like open source contributions, or high percentile scores in programming competitions. (I interviewed several people with no CS-related degrees at Google.)

A big company has to communicate a policy change like this to a lot of people to be effective - hiring managers, HR, dedicated recruiters, you might tell ICs who conduct interviews as a courtesy... enough people that it's not wrong to consider it an announcement. And they also probably won't say "by the way, keep this a secret". So pretty much everyone is gonna know

A big company would tell the recruiting team within HR and maybe update some internal HR docs. How they filter applicants changes a lot and they're not going to announce every change to everyone.

And they're certainly not going to give this much info about the change to ICs,

According to upper management, it's because the volume of self-taught applicants is too high (a few thousand per posting) and the quality of self-taught applicants is too low. Apparently a lot of teams have hired self taught developers and it's gone very bad.

But sure, maybe they told HR and then leadership and OP's director or VP gave some candid talk to his org. But this would be extremely strange behavior at big tech.

Maybe they actually want semi-experienced coders who have a history of learning random esoteric dialects of established languages, and math/physics majors would probably not be super experienced in that learning cycle, rather would be more about how to do small amounts of coding to fit their use case? I say this as a stats major who has worked with many CS and math majors.

I think just because you have a degree in physics doesn’t mean you took any coding classes. So it’s still kind of self taught if you do code.

I've noticed that the purpose of classes in school is often just to speed run students to the next class...no regard for even a quick summary of why it matters.

It's like Calculus, which is useful but teachers rarely explain the basic application sections of the material... which is knowing how rates or sums of change really work.

We're a big tech company, fully remote, starting pay for juniors is around ~150k USD.

This just sounds fake. Judging by the username and posting history, I'd guess that it is.

A lot of Redditors want to reflexively poop on traditional degrees from reputable Universities/Colleges because frankly it was kind of trendy to and also a lot of folks don't have a 4 year degree, so I think inferiority complex definitely played a part. Granted, there's legit cons (time commitment, varying roi, access, etc.) tied to a 4 year degree. However, in the vast majority of cases, a degree in CS/CIS is the right way to go...even an Associates tbh. A formal education provides a solid foundation, level of rigor and depth that learning just on your own will not provide. I 100% get why some companies are hesitant to hire self taught Developers and filter out non-degreed applicants for Junior positions. Having said that, of course there's always exceptions to this and I applaud anyone that is self taught and is able to acquire a lot of the foundational stuff you'd miss by not getting a degree in CS/CIS (theory, engineering, math in the case of CS and business/domain knowledge in the case of CIS).

Things like this are very hush hush and would be kept to HR. No way upper management would communicate this to the masses. I get the feeling OP is a CS grad who can't land a job and figures there's no harm in discouraging the competition.

I have a master's in CS, but I have met plenty of self-taught people who are excellent engineers and I have met plenty of shit engineers with CS master's degrees.

Sounds like your company's hiring managers are not doing a good job when interviewing candidates. Even if your company bans managers from hiring self-taught candidates, there is still the problem of managers hiring unqualified people. That needs to be fixed.

Nah, i see where they are coming from.

Hiring is not about finding the best candidate anymore as it is finding a good enough candidate.

If I were given thousands of resumes, I wanna get rid of as many as possible even if it means getting rid of perfect candidates.

As a tradeoff though, I think we should abandon the idea that hiring is meritocratic and that the inability to land a job is attributed to a "skills issue", which is a common notion I see in this field/sub.

It’s an efficiency thing. Sure in an ideal world with unlimited resources and time, you could assess everybody well.

Interesting take. I'm sure there are a bunch of cool self taught people in CS but there definitely are people who barely have any experience with code who just want to get a good salary. The volume of such people applying is definitely too high currently. Fair opinion honestly.

I am not gonna dispute the validity of this particular post, but I worked in a company that did that around 1.5 years ago. And I hear plenty of companies do it now. This move isn’t as „out there” as people suggest in this post.

IT recruiting is kind of failing because of its own success if that makes sense. Bootcamp owners and recruiters spent years convincing others that just anyone can become a software dev, general public believed them and now about anyone tries to become a dev. And I honestly wish them luck, but I just don’t think everyone is suited for that job, contrary to what people selling courses will tell you.

I am not exactly self-taught, but I haven’t finished IT degree per se (different engineering, my Uni programme was heavy on programming tho). I would probably have harder time getting a job with that degree comparing to people with CS degree.

This has long been predicted to happen during the next pull-back in hiring. When there's a shortage of workers, companies lower their hiring standards. It famously happened in 1999 and happened again in the late aughts. With AI I'm not sure there will ever be another shortage of that magnitude.

This requirement is becoming quite common. Self-taught or boot camp employees take more upskilling (a generalization, of course) than uni grads. Given the job-hopping trend, these hires don't stay long enough to return value commensurate with their onboarding costs.

Whenever we open a new entry level software position at my company, we get thousands of applications flooding in. The crappy things is that you have a lot of people hoping to get in because they know how to write an if-statement or a really basic script. It ruins it for those who are truly self taught.

I'm trying to get it in place for my current company, but in a previous software company, we had a basic coding test applicants had to go through before they could submit an application. Only people who passed the test would move on to be considered for interviews. It weeded out all the people who watched one or two YouTube videos or people who wrote a simple "hello world" application over a weekend to people who actually learned the concepts they needed for the job. Plus this filter was something that was automated and didn't require us to talk spend very much time on a candidate until we could determine that were a serious candidate.

I'm a big fan of providing opportunities to a wide array of people from various backgrounds, so having a test anyone can take provides a way for self taught people, coding boot camp people, degree people, and work experience people all to have an equal chance at getting an interview.

Salary information at tech companies is pretty transparent, you could verify this in like 30 seconds.
I have to move across the country to work in an office so I can participate in “our company culture” while half our team works from other locations, not to mention entire new teams are being stood up in India. We’re all remote from each other anyways, why are you forcing me drive to an office where every meeting is a video call anyways?

No they mean multiple jobs. Ever heard of overemployment? Shit since WFH I’ve been able to day trade. It’s been fantastic. Many people do multiple remote jobs and employers don’t want that.

There’s a whole subreddit for this.

Also tax benefits for having people in office. States give it to the big companies:

Shit since WFH I’ve been able to day trade. It’s been fantastic.

Daytrade is a trap and a fool’s errand, please stop now before you learn too late.

Warren Buffet didn’t get rich off daytrading.

Nancy Pelosi’s husband isn’t even daytrading either, he’s doing “Leaps” long term option calls.

If daytrading was highly profitable you wouldn’t see a million different YouTubers trying to sell you a course on it.

Fidelity did a study where the best preforming portfolios were done by customers who traded little to none. They just buy and hold longterm.

Daytrading is not worth it, unless you’re a high frequency trading hedge fund, or you’re a quant with a successful algorithm to automatically place and sell trades, however even as an algo-trader your trades are still not as fast enough to compete with the speeds of hedge funds.

In other words stop daytrading and just invest instead.

The most important factor is really the informational advantage that professionals have.

You're not even "up against" them. Retail brokerages are often selling your trade information or doing other nasty stuff that basically guarantees every trade you make is rigged against you.

They're great white sharks and you're not even a shark. You're the chum and your brokerage is serving you up as a snack.

Old Wall Street saying, "everyone's a genius in a rising market".

Can agree to that.

Used to day trade but the profits were just shit. I used to earn 2k to 3k per month as profit.

But, I started buying and holding shares. After few months, I earned more in few months than I could in a year with day trading. Imagine earning 40% profit in just 3 months with total amount invested. I put 30k and earned roughly 20k in three months.

Most employment contracts and agreements stipulate a "moonlighting" clause that prohibits you from having another full time role at the same time.

It's not legally binding or anything, unless you're like a surgeon or a nuclear reactor tech maybe, or a pilot, etc.

But if an employer finds out you're working another gig that is full time it's a terminable offense because well you did sign that agreement, and they get to set policy.

As far as why they'd care? Maybe 1 in 10 employees would be productive and efficient enough to do both jobs to their fullest potential, the rest take from the goose and give to the gander.

Also, companies don't want you to have options like that. Which is ironic because everyone is all "design the high availability so that the thing still works even if most of it goes sideways!"

Well they don't want you to be resilient and highly fault tolerant in terms of the job market -- they want you to stay in your box, take your 2% annual merit increase if you're lucky enough to get that, and if you don't like it they want you to be scared of having to "start over" some place else after the hassle of interviewing, changing roles, maybe moving somewhere, all of that.

Being able to tell Company A well hey fuck you, and I'll be fine because I already have B and C on the "payroll" so to speak, is ideal for the worker but very not ideal for the employer.

But y'know, fuck em. Workers interests are always at odds with employers interests so who gives a fuck what they think

Also, the reward for efficient productivity is more work. If you get your job done and hide the fact that you still have a productive drive that's "money" you're "taking away" from them. If you're three hours into the work day and completed every task given to you, do you report you're done? My advice: no. Because they don't want you to do your salary's worth of work.

How common is the overworking thing, though, really? Myself and a lot of my peers are WFH and one job is plenty of work. I don't even know how that'd work. It's also against policy in every job I've worked and seems like a great way to stress out and lose all your jobs.

I don't doubt it happens, but feels like an overblown fear if that's really what employers are worried about.

My employer went the other way. They own the floor of the building we're on, we originally used to use half of it. We slimmed down they leased to other people. Covid happened, they leased to other people. Now they cut almost all office space, it's down to 2 offices and 5 desks, from 3 offices and 20 desks with 3 boardrooms. I went into the office to move my computer a few weeks ago, was the first time I was at the office in years.

Obviously you’re responsible for your work whether at home or in-office. But they’re much more easily able to call you into an impromptu project status meeting when you’re right around the corner (though of course they can ping you or tag you in a status document).

I should’ve said “can’t monitor you as openly and easily.” It’s easier to monitor you when you’re on the same WiFi network than on your home network. And while companies can read your communications, they’re not actively sitting and going through them unless there’s a flag up.

Also the remote job pool is an absolute disaster. I’d say about 95% of the applicants are either seriously under qualified or outright fake. Zoom calls make you question where they’re from and most have ‘unstable’ connections. Our typical posting gets several hundred resumes in a few hours, our filtering brings it down to a half dozen or so to interview to realize that nearly all of our interviewees are fake, with the real one frankly not great. This leaves us with taking on a middling candidate or restart the process

Can someone explain the lease thing to me? I’ve seen this point so much but it never makes sense. In an occupied or unoccupied building costs the same to them. However unoccupied you can cut costs everywhere. Electricity, water, office supplies, internet, office furniture, etc.

If they are worried about bottom lines, this should be the first thing you attack. Especially if they put in your contract you are responsible for having your own internet and etc.

A lease is for a fixed term and a consistent cost. If you were responsible for a 5 year renewal on an office that nobody uses, it's not a great look to your investors. Never mind where you own a building like Apple with their $5 billion investment that they'll never ever get back. I'd be calling people back to the office if I'd sunk that much into real estate.

That and if you're C level you're probably invested in assets which would include some aspect of commercial property. That kind of affects everyone with investments of some sort.

I’m friendly with my coworkers, but not in the same way as I was in the past, when I was in the office. This then makes it very easy for me to move on without a problem. It wasn’t impossible back when I was in the office but it’s even easier now

As a senior engineer have no problems I’m pretty much self-guided. I know exactly what I need to do and I only pop up when I have questions for people however, for junior engineers much more difficult. They can’t really pop in and ask questions. I could definitely see some of them, missing out on the mentorship part of the workplace

I feel like this is just a WFH culture issue as much as it would be in an office though. Junior engineers should have the ability and comfort to ask for help or advice. Anyone should have that

But you have to make it a conscious effort as an organization to setup that environment and channels through online sources

It might be slightly harder and it's new to a lot of people, but it's very possible

Nah, I would have to disagree there. Juniors know they are free to slack me and setup meeting anytime. I promptly answer all requests and I’m very available but it’s not the same as being in the office because it’s not the same as spending basically 8 hours together. Also often companies I was with we would have lunches or team outings to further build a bond and trust

I try to joke around w colleagues and get to know them at a personal level but we don’t have the same comfort as if we were in person which I’m ok with but I could see others having problems

My fiance is a therapist and she wishes she could refuse to provide teletherapy.. Especially with couples. It's very difficult to bond and truly understand the nuances of interactions with people.

That being said, I think it's a question of do you need this from a job? How much bonding is required to do good work? I join some of my meetings with cameras on and have gotten to know a few members of my team very well and we have a good time. I don't work more because of it, I also don't do better work.

My biggest complaint of wfh is the inability to get help. A lot of my teammates aren't reachable on teams. They will disappear for hours and hours throughout the day. It may take 4 messages over two days to get any help.

I think it depends on the company. My company is largely remote. We don’t have enough office space to bring even half the company into the office now.

We are really good at mentoring and helping each other remotely. We use Slack and just jump into a huddle and do pair programming. I was actually doing this at other jobs while in the office. You can see the whole desktop via Huddles and it is so much easier than standing over someone’s desk and disturbing everyone around. Works out really good.

In the office or not I think rewarding teams with bonuses/recognition for meeting milestones and good collaboration goes further than being in the office or not.

I also feel like in most cases the whole process can take a while. A jr has a question and you're in the office? He can visually judge if your too busy or not, if you're not he can just pop by, if you are, he can wait until you go get coffee of something. Ask the question, the sr may check the jr's screen. Everything is done in like 5/10 minutes.

Having to do that online? First they/you won't see the message for 3 hours. Or it is not very well explained and you have to ask for clarification.Then you may have to schedule a meeting, which can be a whole other issue, because a meetings feel psychologically different than just stopping by. Then you have problems, your internet sucks that day, your mic is not working, you're using linux and the screen sharing on Teams is giving you problems.

This type of semi formal communication is an issue that I do believe is worse when WFH. Probably the only big issue imho.

Literally the solution to this is quarterly off-sites with the team.

Ditch your commercial real estate. Use a fraction of that spend to fly people out quarterly to bond and work together.

My company does this. I know many others, like Yelp, Atlassian, Salesforce and others do as well.

My team is super vocal and we help each other a lot, pair programming is frequent. We also have a 24/7 teams meeting we can chill in optionally so we treat that like a good old voice chat channel...

I fail to see how wed cooperate better in office. All it would bring is more time spent talking about random stuff.

I can only speak to early stage companies, as I know many founders and am one myself (although, I am pro-remote).

Some common reasons:

It's their baby. They didn't want to go in when it was for other companies but now it's theirs they want tight control and to form it exactly how they want. It's less fun for them if it's remote.

They don't know how to hire for remote. It requires a different strategy and you need to look for different signals.

It's seen as an unnecessary risk. You have a million and one risks to worry about. Your goal in moving the company forward is really mitigating and reducing as many risks as possible. If they don't feel strongly, they will choose the seemingly less risky option.

Investors insist on it. Quite a few VCs won't invest in remote-first companies for various reasons (some unknown).

Remote is an easy scapegoat. If you have failed to deliver, you can make it seem to investors things will improve if you return to office. Just say that the remote experiment failed. It's not because the founder had an unviable business model.

I work remote for an early stage company (joined pre-seed, coming up on series B), and while these weren't concerns for our particular org, I've seen this for others (and we've worked through these reasons all together when deciding if we'd ever go into an office) and, while I wouldn't work at these orgs the reasons are certainly reasonable.

One I would add is that other departments (sales, marketing) will often prefer to be in office together. You have to keep the org healthy and happy, and that isn't just engineers, even in a tech startup. We solved it by having regular all-company get-togethers (we get a WeWork for a few days a quarter), and sales and other groups have satellite 'offices' near them that they optionally work together at.

Why would investors insist on it?

If we're being honest with ourselves, having a group of people co-located together is going to move faster and more efficiently in quick decision making, organic brainstorming, getting people unblocked, etc etc etc

It forces everyone to be focused and in sync.

These benefits are less true at much larger companies as to whether you're in the office or not with your immediate team. You're already bogged down in doc writing and sync meetings with teams who are already not in the same timezone as yours that it barely changes things. In fact, for big companies, WFH may actually be more efficient.

+1 this is the real underlying reason in most cases.

As much as people love to talk about how they are just as productive at home, it's a different type of productivity.

Remote work benefits work/problems that are easily split into parallel isolated tracks. If you have a 3 week project to build something which largely doesn't need/impact/interact with others? Remote is great - no distractions, go to town.

But if that 3 week project requires 10 touch points with different people, or worse you don't know it will require that many but it ends up needing a bunch? Yikes. Remote is worse by far.

I think a lot of engineers too want the model where someone splits work into multi-day isolated work chunks they can do without interacting with others.

Multiple possibilities:

Older generations are still leading some companies and are sticking to their old ways. They literally don't understand younger generations. They all say, "Back in my day…"

Some companies had invested in physical office spaces by signing 10-, 15- or even 20-year contracts pre-COVID, or even outright buying properties pre-COVID. Then they don't want to admit their investment backfired, so they pretend that WFH is going against "company culture."

Some jobs actually need to be in-person, and I say this as a permanent remote employee. For example, if your company has physical tech in the office (namely servers) and you are partly responsible for maintaining it, then you really do need to be there.

I think number 1 is usually the main culprit. And yeah not much you can do about 3. I’ve worked in DoD my entire career and never have an issue with that, though work can be mixed so you can still WFH in many DoD positions.

When you give people freedom to choose their working conditions you get more buy in and some people will sometimes be encouraged to come into the office to meet with their colleagues. Putting blanket requirements to be in office for no reason only pisses people off and makes them lose focus from their job.

I work fully remotely. WFH is more popular now than before. That said, there's a few reasons companies are reluctant to make everything fully remote.

It's nice when talent is local. Nothing like everyone in one room hashing things out. Several startups I interviewed with seem to want people to be local even if working remotely because when in a pinch they just want to get a wework space and hash things out.

It's very very hard to onboard new employees, especially new grads, remotely. You need a very very strong remote culture to be able to do that without too many problems.

I worked at a global remote type company previously. We were all local with a few specialists working fully remotely to start with. During the pandemic, they made it fully remote and hired people all around the world. It was HELL and I hated it. I was blocked a lot because people weren't in the same timezone as I was and weren't online the same hours I was. I ended up having to work at all hours just to coordinate with people and it messed my mental health and family life to such an extent that I had to quit.

I've worked at companies previously where shit wouldn't get done until you actually showed up at their goddamn desk and said "hey do this for me". Having that option is quite valuable.

It's really hard to have a company culture while fully remote. You can get coding done if you're organized enough. Other kinds of jobs are quite dependent on interpersonal connections, and it's hard to nurture those unless there's an office culture. It becomes quite hard to progress beyond a point without an in-person culture.

I'm increasingly seeing companies want jobs to be hybrid. They recognize the jobs to be doable fully remotely, but they want to be able to have in-person events and some kind of office culture happening so they can have new grads connect and be groomed, and be able to scale up in-person stuff when there is a necessity instead of that being off the table.

It's really hard to bond with people without being present in person. I like my colleagues a lot, but I honestly have no clue what their lives are like and it feels too rude to even ask. Slack channels go out to the whole goddamn company and it becomes super hard to be yourself. Most messages are either super curated or the informal channels become dominated by the noisiest few people. I miss having lunch with colleagues and earlier in my career, I made great lifelong friends at work despite being quite an introvert. I don't see too many opportunities for that now and that makes work life a lot less rich. I like the option to have to be in office now and then and get to know your colleagues well enough.

I don't know why amazon expects you to badge in everyday even if you're in a different location from the rest of your team etc, that seems to be some big-company ass-covering, but also amazon seems to constantly do a lot of crap that inconveniences employees for no reason.

If you set aside the "they hate us" kind of responses, there is 1 big one. Ramp up of new hires is not good with wfh. Or, the management perception of the ramp up of new hires is not good at least.

I'm sure there are some teams that have mastered integrating new hires with remote, but a lot of us kind of sucked at it. It's extremely noticeable how much worse the covid hires are compared to how my peer group was at the same level of experience. For my job, part of it is increased hiring and the inevitable lowering of standards, but my managers definitely believe that wfh is playing a role. Our new(er) hires have also commented on how much more they feel like they're learning from us being in the office together.

We’re all remote from each other anyways

The end state is that we won't be remote from each other. People will be moved around to be colocated within the same cities eventually. My team has frozen hiring but we've already preparing to change from us/canada hiring to seattle only.

I think the ramp up issue is legitimate, especially for juniors. I just started my first job in January with a hybrid schedule and I really don’t feel like I’m progressing as much when I’m at home. The friction to ask questions is also much higher because I can’t just pop my head over a cubicle, conversations take longer to resolve, verbal discussion requires zoom meetings, etc.

Maybe for juniors but I've been remote for the past 5 years and never had any issues ramping up. In fact, I feel I ramp up faster when I'm remote because I don't have a bunch of people I don't know coming up and trying to chat with me when I'm trying to get through some onboarding work. And the same goes for people I've onboarded. Here's a doc that has every step you need to complete. Ask me any question and there is no such thing as a stupid question. It's really not that hard.

Then your department/group is doing it wrong. You should have a mentor or buddy on speed-dial or chat that you can ask any question at any time. That's the secret sauce.

The barrier is, quite often, the new person is afraid to ask via chat, but less-so in person. Doubt creeps in while remote those first few weeks. Breaking that down is key and is easily solved.

They saw this where I work too. More people who ramped up remote were fired or quit within the first year compared to pre COVID hires. It’s especially true with junior hires.

The other interesting factor is a reduction in trust. People don’t know others on different teams. It has created more of an “us vs them” culture where other people are just boxes on a screen.

I think it’s made the culture harsher and less personable

Lots of companies do want people to work remotely, so they can hire more cheaply and have a larger pool of candidates, and more easily let people go with minimal drama. The positions can get more competitive since they get more applications from people across the country instead of just people willing to relocate or already in the area.

--

I know it will be insanely unpopular on this sub and probably heavily downvoted, but there are plenty of advantages to working together onsite. You get easier mentorship and collaboration, stronger team bonding, being able to know for sure that someone is available to ask a question or out for the day, etc. There are certain natural collaborations that happen from being in the same room and having a coffee break together, or looking over at what your neighbor is doing, and those kinds of interactions don't really happen organically over most remote work setups. Some people like Steve Jobs have tried to take that to an extreme, doing things like designing the building in specific ways to maximize little chance encounters for unexpected collaborations. Working remote is like doing the opposite- you don't interact unless you've specifically scheduled or called someone. There might be tons of people you never interact with at all because they're in a slightly different team or department, but if you worked in the office you might meet on the regular, chat about different things, learn from each other, make friends, etc.

Obviously there are different advantages to working remotely as well, like no commute, a broader talent pool, more flexibility etc. But that makes it a legitimate tradeoff with real upsides and downsides for both policies.

I work remotely right now, and I'm very glad to be home since I have a baby and it's easy to take a break and help my family out. But I also know I'm also personally less productive and definitely less in tune with my coworkers. I'm glad I worked previously in my career on site, where I had more direct mentorship and built up some skills and strong connections, and I could see myself doing it again sometime in the future.

RTO doesn't make sense when part of the team is distributed. However, the hard truth that this sub hates to admit is that being in person as part of a collaborative team leads to casual conversations about work and discuss ideas that can yield dividends. These tend to happen a lot less in remote cultures, as there are less opportunities for this to happen organically when everyone is working in their silos.

Of course there are trade offs, but this sub loves to act like there's no benefit to working in the office other than objectively negative reasons like micromanaging.

Something not talked about are the tax breaks large companies receive from these cities for bringing head count to stimulate the economy in said city.

If the head count doesn’t meet a certain threshold, said company is no longer entitled to said tax break. We’re talking big bucks here, especially in cities like SF, NY, and Seattle.

Feel like people always leave this tidbit out. While there really is a lot of people that thrive and are productive in a WFH setting, there are absolutely people that DO NOT.

I've had so many co-workers that slacked off so hard in WFH setting and they would constantly push their ticket back and couldn't really explain in detail why they are falling behind and are unresponsive in chats.

These bad apples honestly ruin the whole WFH culture.

I hate to agree with this, but I do. I'm productive working from home, and I know plenty of people who were/are, but I had this one (very young) coworker who would leave without telling people, miss meetings, and go run errands. It was frustrating when you needed to get a hold of him. I have no issue with people taking breaks -- and they should -- but if it's during core hours, you need to be available to answer questions within a reasonable amount of time (i.e., not hours later or the next day).

On a different tangent, I've noticed a tendency of remote people messaging me off-hours. If I'm not on call, don't message me at ten at night or one in the morning. I'm not answering unless it's an emergency. And if I wasn't given a heads-up, I'm not answering at all.

Truthfully, it is more difficult to create a “team” culture virtually. Not impossible, but it adds a degree of difficulty. 

And yeah, it’s slightly easier for someone to skate by doing nothing at home for longer. I have a better pulse on what my in-office people are working on vs my international offices. But there are ways to help work around that.

I work in a large IT organization (several thousand people), and the most effective people are those who have built a network of people across the organization.  While most of us love WFH and we have a degree of flexibility to do that about half the week, there’s a broad recognition that during the pandemic we all met fewer new people, and lost touch with colleagues we’d normally see in the break room, and thereby missed out on some of the “oh yeah, I heard you are working on xyz, have y’all considered…” conversation that happens spontaneously. 

If your IT job is “take this requirement, code it”, that is probably less important than if you’re interacting with a customer base daily and designing enterprise-level systems. 

We do have international offices, and so some of our teams do most of their work virtually. However - I have personally experienced that teams that meet face to face, even just once, have an incredible jump in camaraderie and productivity compared with teammates who have never met each other. Personally, that’s how I’d run a department; fully remote with several mandatory f2f meetings a year based on what makes sense for that team/department.

Incentives and power plays.

Control - you have too much freedom and too much flexibility when you work from home.They need to monitor you. It doesn't matter if you're more efficient than your coworkers, because companies realized this and they want to get their moneys worth. Instead of getting your work done early then working on a side grind, you now get to sit at a desk for 8 hours in a noisy open office plan.

Economics - Two sides to this. The company might have expensive real estate that isn't being utilized. Leadership has to justify why it isn't being utilized. They also may have tax incentives gives from local municipalities because they bring workers and (more importantly) money to the local business.

Constructive Dismissal - The real gambit. Tech companies realized that layoffs are expensive. Instead of reducing headcount directly and incurring a lot of layoff costs through severance, companies figured out that they could just give you an ultimatum by removing WFH as a benefit. This makes them forcefully removing you about your decision not to come into office. No severance required.

I also have a suspicion that businesses can't get out of leases or loans for these properties.

Overall, it's a stupid power play that does have some economic backing. None of the economic backing actually benefits you as an employee. In fact, it does nothing but incur costs to you as an employee.

I can see all the managers in here claiming people slack off etc… but that happens in the office too the only difference is they just sit there all day because they’ll be disciplined if they take too long for lunch or show up too late too early. It’s 100% a control structure issue, people think butts in seats, hours on a clock = productivity which it doesn’t. Corporations in general are misguided completely on productivity now a days.

A lot of people touched on the established reasons (control, real estate, taxes etc). However, the sad truth is that most statistics seem to indicate that overall performance decreases. Almost every large tech company collected formal / informal metrics during the pandemic on the performance of their SWEs during WFH.

In general

Experienced and tenured employees tended to self report higher efficiency

Junior employees self reported a lower efficiency and a lower rate of learning.

Junior employees took statistically longer to get promoted

General high level metrics went down (# of code reviews, # of lines modified etc. useless at individual level, but very informative at the overall company level).

All employees reported less feeling of comradery with other employees.

This is a combination of data I obtained by being both nosy in my current company (where data is mostly not made public even internally) and talking with friends at Google (where a lot of this data was internally public).

All of these metrics track with my personal experience when WFH started. I never bought a house in the country like a lot of my friends because of it, since the initial data pretty much meant that you had to have a mostly senior workforce with below industry attrition to be coming out ahead with WFH. Since most big tech companies rely on a steady stream of juniors to get trained up to replace senior attrition, it wasn't sustainable without a complete rethink of fundamental corporate HR practices.
