My brother in-law (Sammy) lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago. He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago. His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.

Olivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed.

Last straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying. I told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!

Sammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset. Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said "my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this "defect" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is. He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.

I told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from "spending time" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.

She got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.

Everyone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.
NTA. Don't back down. You are the only one sticking up for Zoey. If her cousins want to use expensive makeup, give them your wife's. I guarantee she won't appreciate sharing anymore.

They need to start behaving like appreciative guests.Lol, return underwear with stains? Man, I'd never mess with you.
I love this idea. NTA OP - you have your daughters back and totally get her need for privacy and autonomy over her stuff. Iâ€™m disgusted that her own mother isnâ€™t more supportive. Please lend some mothers makeup to the twins, because obviously itâ€™s what girls do, isnâ€™t it? They love to borrow and use each otherâ€™s stuff. Without asking. Not.
EDIT: Save yourself the time and effort. I turned off notifications.Ya'll need to grow up and stop hurting each other.

Yeah cuz that would make dealing and resolving the situation WAY easier huh? I doubt that would prompt more issues to form. /s

It's OP's home, they need stand firm and not treat it as some "gotcha" prank war. That would only further his guests entitlement and shitty parenting decisions. Not to mention other shit storms that could cause.

I swear, this sub has some real petty kids pretending to give advice.
Bonus if OP goes into Sammy's room to borrow things without asking. Underwear, an expensive watch or something. Returning it with visible wear and tear. Nutella would be my friend for his favorite pants.
My older sister constantly used the expensive colouring pencils I saved up for over a year to buy (and constantly anxiously checking this big box was still for sale whenever we were in the store). I was 12, sister was 16. My mom's reaction to my tearful pleas to stop my sister? "She's much better at drawing than you are, so stop whining!"

Can't reply anymore since the thread is locked, but thank you all for your kind words and understanding. I have tried going NC with my parents several times but was not supported in that by my then partner (there's a pattern there...) Now I just don't really discuss important things in my life with them anymore, keep contact to a minimum, mostly about the children who do like their grandparents, and patiently await the moment I will receive my inheritance which will help me financially to finally have some freedom.
This. It also bothers me that Sammy dared to call Zoey "defective" when his kids are taking and ruining other people's property.

I have friends that I'm so close to, we will go to each other's gyno appointments to give support if need be. No way in h*ll am I messing with their makeup without permission. My closest friends are twins, and they don't even mess with each other's makeup without asking.

Honestly those two girls were taking extremely expensive stuff to begin eith (a school laptop?) And OP didn't call them theives but if the glove fits...

Im a twin too but I dont go stealing my twins shit (unless its snacks but thats a mutual thing lol).

I honestly feel like the makeup, while seemingly not as 'big' or 'expenisve' as the other things was just the straw that broke the camel's back.

OP, if they never returned the items they took you could ask for reimbursment or start charging them rent if they arent paying rent already.

I would also ask your wife if her supporting her brother and his daughters with them stealing and harming your daughters things is worth the strain on hers and your daughters relationship.

Tell her that her not backing her up and making excuses for horrible behaviour will make her feel not safe in her own home and not cared for by her mother. This is some relationship ruining shit because teenagers need privacy and want to know they are safe in their own home.

And OP is being generous if they are taking stuff and not giving it back because he could have easily of called the cops on the adult twins and say they were stealing from his minor daughter. Not to mention your wife backing up her brother after the hurtful comments.

OP you need to talk to your daughter and alsolet her know if her mother says anything that makes her upset she can come to you and trust you. Your the only one she has!

Plus, sharing makeup is a disgusting and unsanitary practice, at the best of times, and weâ€™re in the middle of a pandemic.

He called Zoey defective for buying and using expensive makeup, so she would look more like an adult. Then his child steals this makeup. Would that not also make the BILs child defective, by his standards?! ðŸ˜‚

Also, what the hell is Sammy's problem that he can even try to pretend that what his daughters are doing is "borrowing". Borrowing implies that they asked permission from Zoey before using her stuff. He knows damn good and well that's not what his kids are doing.

Sammy is a shit brother, uncle, AND father. My god. The divorce thing seems significantly less surprising now, knowing that this is how he actually behaves as a grown ass adult.

Exactly. OP is definitely NTA. Quite frankly, as soon as that worthless BIL opened his mouth to insist his daughters "aren't thieves," I would have let him know that taking items from someone without their knowledge or consent constitutes theft, and those who engage in theft are, in fact, thieves.

OP needs to throw them all out of the house yesterday, his AH wife included. The sheer lack of respect she has for the well being of her own child is shocking and completely unacceptable.

Plus sharing makeup is so unsanitary. That goes on my face, I donâ€™t want someone else also using it on theirs. So gross. Plus if the colors were mixed she was definitely double dipping. I think cousins owe her at least a new makeup pallet. NTA

You know I probably shouldn't be saying this but my wife has been acting like a hypocrite latey. Especially regarding privacy issues. She considers privacy something very important but still thought that Zoey did not have the right to get a lock - Even if we leave her cousins out of this matter. My wife is not agreeing with the whole concept of getting a lock for Zoey. I explained to her what's been happenning, Even told her that Zoey has been moving some of her valuable belongings into a friend's house to keep them safe, do I blame her? Absolutely not. But my wife still thought Zoey was wrong to do that. Now her cousine are upset and they and Sammy are using the silent treatment (among other things like eating without us or not sitting with us) as a guilt tactic. Even though it's not affecting me, it's making Zoey feel like she did something wrong by having a lock for her room.
